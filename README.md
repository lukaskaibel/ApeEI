Welcome to ApeEI, an innovative full-stack application designed to enhance the university experience for students. It combines the power of reflection, interactive assistance, and relevant information to provide a comprehensive learning aid. Utilizing the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT API under the hood, ApeEI becomes a valuable companion for students in their learning journey.

At its core, ApeEI is a smart chatbot capable of delivering thoughtful responses and engaging students in conversation, promoting a deeper understanding of their subjects. It not only assists by answering queries but also brings a world of information to your fingertips by suggesting useful Wikipedia articles that provide further insight. Moreover, ApeEI identifies potential events from your chats, offering a convenient option to create corresponding Google Calendar entries - ensuring you never miss an important date.
