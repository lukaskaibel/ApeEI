The frontend of ApeEI is built using ReactJS with TypeScript, creating a user-friendly interface that interacts seamlessly with our backend.

This basic chat implementation primarily serves as a demonstration of our backend's capabilities, showcasing how the assistant features, event detection, and Wikipedia search functionalities can be integrated into a responsive UI.

Although the UI is designed for demonstration purposes and may not be consumer-ready, it nonetheless provides an effective means of visualizing the potential of ApeEI.
